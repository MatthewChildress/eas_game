This project proved to be more difficult than I thought. 

I had to learn quite about Event Listeners and CSS effects to get this to work alongside finally learning how to use CSS grid. 

I want to return to this and add more CSS pseudo-code to the event listeners as well as a few extra functions to change the color of the titles to reflect the color input.
