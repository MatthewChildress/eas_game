# eas_game

This project proved to be more difficult than I thought. 

I had to learn more about Event Listeners and CSS effects than initially thought to get this to work. I struggled with connecting the input slider to an eventlistener to control the grid sizing. I have some lines of code in place to where the "coloring" part of the page will only work once a mouse button is pressed and moved but need to reevulate what to do in order to get both to be the trigger of functions. I've considered using an If/Else function with && triggers but need to spend more time messing with it.

I also need to finalize the CSS but I promised my wife I'd let her help me style it and she's busy.


This is the second JavaScript project from the Odin Project. The first is linked below.
